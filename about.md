About me
===

I do problems, learning, and science. 

Solutions to various puzzles will accumulate here, centered around the weekly [Fiddler on the proof](https://thefiddler.substack.com/) and the [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/) monthly puzzle. 

You can contact me at josh [.] silverman [@] gmail [.] com.
