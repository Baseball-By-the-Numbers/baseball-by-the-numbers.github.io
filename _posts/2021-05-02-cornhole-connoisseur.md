## Solution

In the cornhole game, we have complete freedom to choose between our **aggressive** thrower, our **conservative** thrower, and our **wasted** thrower. If we make three additional points by game's end, then the game has value $V = 1,$ but if we score any other amount of additional points, then the game has value $V = 0.$ With $4$ throws left, the optimal sequence of moves is a little opaque. 

However, it's easier to see the right move when we have $1$ throw left. 

### The last throw

Of course, it depends on how many points we have. 

If we've $1$ throw left, and zero points, then we should do whatever makes the probability of hitting the hole the highest, since it will get us the full $3$ points we're after. In this case, the clear move is to send the **aggressive** thrower to the line.

If we have two points then the best move is whatever makes the probability of hitting the board the highest, so the best move is to send the **conservative** thrower to the line.

If we have three points then we can only spoil our win by scoring another point, so we should send the wasted thrower to the line.

If we have one point then there is absolutely no chance to win the game, so the best move doesn't matter, we can only lose no matter what we do, and we will.
