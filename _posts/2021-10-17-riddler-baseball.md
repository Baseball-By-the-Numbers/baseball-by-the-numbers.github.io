## Solution

The best thing to do is whatever we expect the best thing to do is.

After each game, we have the opportunity to play our best, so long as we're not in a hopeless position.

Hopeless positions are exactly those that we have no chance to win from. In other words, when A or B have won more than half the games but we have less than 2 correct guesses.

In other words, 

$$
S(\text{less than 2 correct guesses}, \text{4 games won by a team}) = 0.
$$
