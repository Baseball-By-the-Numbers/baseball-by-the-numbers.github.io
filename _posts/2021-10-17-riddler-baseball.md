## Solution

The best thing to do is whatever we expect the best thing to do is.

After each game, we have the opportunity to play our best, so long as we're not in a hopeless position.

Hopeless positions are exactly those that we have no chance to win from. In other words, if we're in a position where A or B have won more than half the games but we still have less than 2 correct guesses logged.

 

$$
S(\text{less than 2 correct guesses}, \text{4 games won by a team}) = 0.
$$
