## Solution

In the standard credit problem, there are $4$ solutions that perform optimally. 

One such solution is to always bet on player A in the first 4 games, then player A in the last 3 games, $\tt{AAAABBB}.$ This only fails to produce 2 correct predictions in the case where player B sweeps the series, or player B wins in 5 games by winning the first three games, then losing, then winning the fifth. 

So, the chance to win with it is 

$$1 - \frac{8}{128} - \frac{4}{128} = 90.625\%.$$

### The main event

After each game, we have the opportunity to play our best, so long as we're not in a **hopeless position**.

### Hopeless positions

Hopeless positions are exactly those that we have no chance to win from. Concretely, any position where A or B have won more than half the games but we still have less than 2 correct guesses logged. 

If we use $S(c,\text{game})$ to represent the probability that a player wins from the position where they have $c$ correct guesses logged, and the current win-loss record is $\text{game}$ (for example, one value this could take would be $\tt{AAAB},$ the series where A wins the first three games and loses the third) then these hopeless positions are described by:

$$
S(\text{less than 2 correct guesses}, \text{4 games won by a team}) = 0.
$$

### Doing our best

If we're not in a hopeless position, then we have a choice to bet on A or B in the next game. In this case, the best thing to do is whatever we _expect_ the best thing to do is.

If we currently have $c$ correct guesses, and we bet on A, we could guess right or wrong, so our expected value is 

$$
\frac12 \overbrace{\langle S(c, \text{game : }\tt{B})\rangle}^\text{we bet on A and are wrong} + \frac12 \overbrace{\langle S(c + 1, \text{game : }\tt{A})\rangle}^\text{we bet on A and are right}
$$

On the other hand, we could bet B, which is worth

$$
\frac12 \overbrace{\langle S(c, \text{game : }\tt{A})\rangle}^\text{we bet on B and are wrong} + \frac12 \overbrace{\langle S(c + 1, \text{game : }\tt{B})\rangle}^\text{we bet on A and area right}
$$

We choose the best of these two options.

### Recursion

So, the expectation that we make at least two successful predictions follows the recursion relation:

$$\begin{align}
\langle S(c,\text{game})\rangle = \max \{ &\frac12 \langle S(c, \text{game : }{\tt{A}})\rangle + \frac12 \langle S(c + 1, \text{game : }{\tt{B}})\rangle, \\
&\frac12 \langle S(c, \text{game : }{\tt{B}})\rangle + \frac12 \langle S(c + 1, \text{game : }{\tt{A}})\rangle
\}
\end{align}$$

Coding this up in Python:

```python
def contains_four(series, N):
  count = max(series.count('A'), series.count('B'))
  if count == 1/2 + N/2:
    return True
  else:
    return False

def S(correct_guesses, series, N, m):
  if correct_guesses < m and contains_four(series, N):
    return 0
  if correct_guesses == m:
    return 1
  return 0.5 * max(
        S(correct_guesses, series + 'A', N, m) 
        + S(correct_guesses + 1, series + 'A', N, m)
      , S(correct_guesses, series + 'B', N, m) 
        + S(correct_guesses + 1, series + 'B', N, m)
      )
```

we calculate for the case at hand $\left(N=7, m=2\right),$ there's a $93.75\%$ chance to win. 

As $N$ increases, the optimal success rate grows as

$$
\langle S(N)\rangle_\text{optimal} = 1 - \dfrac{N+1}{2^{2N}}
$$
