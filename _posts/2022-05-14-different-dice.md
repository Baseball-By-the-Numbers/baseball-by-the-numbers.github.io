## Solution

On first glance, there seem to be many states to track. Each die has four sides, so there are $4^4 = 256$ nominal states. 

Really, there are just a few relevant meta-states:
- the beginning $\boldsymbol{S}$
- two die are the same $\boldsymbol{aabc}$ 
- three die are the same $\boldsymbol{aaab}$ 
- all die are different $\boldsymbol{abcd}$ (the win state)
- two pairs of die are the same $\boldsymbol{aabb}$ (a lose state)
- all four die are the same $\boldsymbol{aaaa}$ (a lose state)

Reaching one of the last three states ends the game, while $aabc$ and $aaab$ are transient.

Also, $\boldsymbol{aaab}$ is equivalent to the starting state $\boldsymbol{S}$ — when the three $a$ get flipped, they are random with respect to $b,$ and it is as if $b$ flipped too.

With this insight, we can merge $\boldsymbol{S}$ and $\boldsymbol{aaab}$ and focus on the reduced game:

## Coarse grained dynamics

The game can end in a win if it goes directly to $abcd,$ or it goes to to $aabc$ or $aaab$, possibly bounces around between them, and then goes to $abcd.$ 

Calling $P(x)$ the probability to win the game from state $x$ and $T(x\rightarrow y)$ the probability of transition from state $x$ to state $y$, the probability of winning the starting state is

$$
  P(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}) =  T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{aabc})P(\boldsymbol{aabc}) + T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{aaab})(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}) + T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{abcd})
$$

Likewise

$$
    \begin{align}
      P(\boldsymbol{aabc}) &= T(\boldsymbol{aabc}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{S/aaab})P(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}) + T(\boldsymbol{aabc}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{aabc})P(\boldsymbol{aabc}) + T(\boldsymbol{aabc}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{abcd}) \\
    \end{align}
$$

In addition to moving to other states, both $\boldsymbol{S/aaab}$ and $\boldsymbol{aabc}$ can loop on themselves.

## Transition combinatorics

To find the transition probabilities from the starting state, $T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{x}),$ we need

1. the number of ways $\Omega(D)$ to pick numbers for the duplicate group $D$
2. the number of ways $\Omega(U)$ to pick numbers for the unique group, $U$
3. the number of ways to order those numbers.

For example, if the target state is $\boldsymbol{aabc}$ then it has $1$ unique member in $D,$ $2$ members of $U$ and the transition probability is

$$
  T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{aabc}) = \overset{\Omega(D)}{\dbinom{4}{1}}\overset{\Omega(U)}{\dbinom{3}{2}}\overset{\text{orders}}{\dfrac{4!}{2!1!1!}}\frac{1}{4^4} = \frac{144}{256}.
$$

Carrying this through gets

$$
  \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{abcd}) & \binom{0}{0}\binom{4}{4}\frac{4!}{1!1!1!1!}\frac{1}{4^4} & \frac{3}{32}\\ \hline
    T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{aabc}) & \binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{2}\frac{4!}{2!1!1!}\frac{1}{4^4} & \frac{9}{16} \\ \hline
    T(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{aaab}) & \binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{1}\frac{4!}{3!1!}\frac{1}{4^4} & \frac{3}{16}.
  \end{array} 
$$

We also need the transition probabilities between the transient state, and from the transient state to $\boldsymbol{abcd}.$

To go from $\boldsymbol{aabc}$ to $\boldsymbol{S/aaab},$ the duplicates need to reroll as either both $\boldsymbol{b}$ or both $\boldsymbol{c}$ 

$$
  \begin{align}
    T(\boldsymbol{aabc} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{aaab}) &= \binom{2}{1}\frac{1}{4^2} \\
    &= \frac{1}{8}.
  \end{align}
$$

We can check our insight above by doing the same calculation in the other direction. There are two possibilities: 
- $2$ of the rerolls are duplicates of each other and the third is another number different from $\boldsymbol{b},$ or 
- $1$ of the rerolls is a duplicate of $\boldsymbol{b}$ and the other two are distinct numbers each different from $\boldsymbol{b},$ so we get

$$
  \begin{align}
    T(\boldsymbol{aaab} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{aabc}) &= \left[\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}\frac{3!}{2!} + \binom{3}{2}\frac{3!}{1!1!1!}\right]\frac{1}{4^3} \\
      &= \frac{9}{16},
  \end{align}
$$

as expected.

Carrying on like this, we can get the remaining transition probabilities:

$$
  \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    T(\boldsymbol{aabc}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{S/aaab}) & \binom{2}{1}\frac{1}{4^2} & \frac{1}{8} \\ \hline
    T(\boldsymbol{aabc} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{aabc}) & \left[4^2 - 3\binom{2}{1}\right]\frac{1}{4^2} & \frac{5}{8} \\ \hline
    T(\boldsymbol{aabc} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{abcd}) & \binom{2}{1}\frac{1}{4^2} & \frac{1}{8}
  \end{array} 
$$


<!--     T(\boldsymbol{aaab}\rightarrow \boldsymbol{aabc}) & \left[\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}\frac{3!}{2!1!} + \binom{3}{2}\frac{3!}{1!1!1!}\right]\frac{1}{4^3} &  \frac{36}{64} \\ \hline
    T(\boldsymbol{aaab} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{aaab}) & \left[\binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{1}\frac{3!}{2!1!}\right]\frac{1}{4^3} & \frac{12}{64} \\ \hline --         T(\boldsymbol{aaab} \rightarrow \boldsymbol{abcd}) & \frac{3!}{1!1!1!}\frac{1}{4^3} & \frac{6}{64} -->

## The probability to win, $P(\boldsymbol{S/aaab})$

With the transition probabilities in hand, the equations for $P(\boldsymbol{aabc})$ and $P(\boldsymbol{aaab})$ become 

$$
  \begin{align}
    P(\boldsymbol{aabc}) &= \frac18 P(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}) + \frac58 P(\boldsymbol{aabc}) + \frac18 \\
    P(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}) &= \frac{3}{16}P(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}) + \frac{9}{16}P(\boldsymbol{aabc}) + \frac{3}{32} \\
   \end{align}
 $$

which yields $P(\boldsymbol{aabc})= 29/60$ and
$$
  \boxed{P(\boldsymbol{S/aaab}) = \dfrac{9}{20} = 45\%}.
$$
