>**Question**:

During a step, for each side of the active square, the absolute difference between the numbers on that sideâ€™s endpoints is assigned to its midpoint. Then these four new midpoints are connected into a new square (tilted $45$ degrees from the previous). This new smaller square becomes the active square. Continue these steps until the active square has all zeroes on its corners.

## Solution

First of all, the map from one square to the next is 

$$ \left(a,b,c,d\right) \overset{M}{\longrightarrow} \left(\lvert a-b\rvert, \lvert b-c\rvert, \lvert c-d\rvert, \lvert d-a\rvert\right). $$

<!-- from this we can see two properties of the map:

1. the map is  -->

We can follow the map on a couple of squares to get the hang of it:

We want to find the starting configuration $(a,b,c,d)$ that takes the most map iterations to reach the $\left(0,0,0,0\right)$ square. 

From the map, we can see two properties of $f$:

1. $f$ is invariant under uniform translations

$$ f(a,b,c,d) = f(a+k,b+k,c+k,d+k),$$

2. and $f$ is invariant under uniform scaling

$$ f(a,b,c,d) = f(\gamma a, \gamma b, \gamma c, \gamma d). $$

The second property shows that we can think of $(a,b,c,d)$ as a relative composition (normalize it so that its components sum to $1$). If we can find a composition $(a,b,c,d)$ that maps back to itself then, in principle, the value of $f$ would be infinite. 

We will look for such a composition, and then look for the closest integer approximation we can find. The bigger the numbers we use, the more closely we should be able to approximate the ideal composition.

If $(a,b,c,d)$ maps to itself, then, up to an overall multiplicative constant

$$ (a,b,c,d) = \left(\lvert a-b\rvert, \lvert b-c\rvert, \lvert c-d\rvert, \lvert d-a\rvert\right). $$

Since the two compositions are the same, ratios between like components are the same as well. Taking the ratio of the first and second components of each composition, we get:

$$
  \begin{align} 
      \frac{a}{b} &= \dfrac{\lvert a - b\rvert}{\lvert b-c\rvert} \\
    &= \frac{a}{b}\dfrac{\lvert 1-\frac{b}{a}\rvert}{\lvert 1-\frac{c}{b}\rvert}.
  \end{align}
$$

Which shows that $b/a = c/b.$ The same comparison for the second and third components shows that $c/b = d/c$ as well.

Putting it all together, we have shown that $a = \gamma b = \gamma^2 c = \gamma^3 d,$ which shows that $(a,b,c,d)$ is monotonic

Now, if we compare the first and fourth components, we get (assuming $a>b>c>d,$ and therefore $\gamma > 1$):

$$
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d}{a} &= \dfrac{\lvert d-a\rvert}{\lvert a-b\rvert} \\
    \gamma^3 &= \dfrac{1 - \gamma^3}{1-\gamma},
  \end{align}
$$

or $2\gamma^3 -\gamma^4 - 1 = 0,$ which has one relevant root

$$
  \begin{align}
    \gamma &= \frac13 \left(1 + \sqrt[3]{\left(19 - 3 \sqrt{33}\right)} + \sqrt[3]{19 + 3 \sqrt{33}}\right) \\
    &\approx 1.8393\ldots
  \end{align}
$$

So, an ideal composition vector is given by 

$$ \dfrac{1}{1+\gamma+\gamma^2+\gamma^3}\left(1,\gamma,\gamma^2,\gamma^3\right), $$ 

which is stationary under the map, as expected. From here we can just scaled the composition vector, looking for its closest integer approximation, which is

$$ \phi = \left(10301680,5600910,3045153,1655616\right). $$

Running this through $f$ gets $f(\phi) = 44.$

Because of the first property, we can subtract the minimum entry from each component of the composition vector without changing the value of $f,$ so the vector with minimum sum is 

$$ \phi = \left(8646064,3945294,1389537,0\right). $$
