>**Question**:
>Assign four nonnegative integers to the corners of a square, which we designate the active square. During a step, for each side of the active square, the absolute difference between the numbers on that sideâ€™s endpoints is assigned to its midpoint. Then these four new midpoints are connected into a new square (tilted $45$ degrees from the previous). This new smaller square becomes the active square. Continue these steps until the active square has all zeroes on its corners.

## Solution

first of all, the map from one square to the next is 

$$ \left(a,b,c,d\right) \overset{M}{\longrightarrow} \left(\lvert a-b\rvert, \lvert b-c\rvert, \lvert c-d\rvert, \lvert d-a\rvert\right). $$

<!-- from this we can see two properties of the map:

1. the map is  -->

we can follow the map on a couple of squares to get the hang of it

we want to find the starting configuration $(a,b,c,d)$ that takes the most map iterations to reach the $\left(0,0,0,0\right)$ square. 

from the map, we can see two properties of $f$:

1. $f$ is invariant under uniform translations

$$ f(a,b,c,d) = f(a+k,b+k,c+k,d+k) $$
  
2. $f$ is invariant to uniform scaling

$$ f(a,b,c,d) = f(\gamma a, \gamma b, \gamma c, \gamma d). $$

the second property shows that we can think of $(a,b,c,d)$ as a relative composition (normalize it so that its components sum to $1$). in principle, if we can find a composition $(a,b,c,d)$ that maps back to itself, the value of $f$ would be infinite. 

we will look for such a composition, and then look for the closest integer approximation we can find. the bigger numbers we use, the more closely we should expect to get.

if $(a,b,c,d)$ maps to itself, then, up to an overall multiplicative constant:

$$ (a,b,c,d) = \left(\lvert a-b\rvert, \lvert b-c\rvert, \lvert c-d\rvert, \lvert d-a\rvert\right). $$

since the two compositions are the same, ratios between like components are the same. taking the ratio of the first and second components of each composition, we get:

$$
  \begin{align} 
      \frac{a}{b} &= \dfrac{\lvert a - b\rvert}{\lvert b-c\rvert} \\
    &= \frac{a}{b}\dfrac{\lvert 1-\frac{b}{a}\rvert}{\lvert 1-\frac{c}{b}\rvert}.
  \end{align}
$$

which shows that $b/a = c/b.$ the same comparison for the second and third components shows that $c/b = d/c$ as well.

putting it together, we have shown that $a = \gamma b = \gamma^2 c = \gamma^3 d,$ which shows that $(a,b,c,d)$ is monotonic

now, if we compare the first and fourth components, we get (assuming $a>b>c>d,$ and therefore $\gamma > 1$):

$$
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d}{a} &= \dfrac{\lvert d-a\rvert}{\lvert a-b\rvert} \\
    \gamma^3 &= \dfrac{1 - \gamma^3}{1-\gamma},
  \end{align}
$$

or $2\gamma^3 -\gamma^4 - 1 = 0$ which has one relevant root

$$
  \begin{align}
    \gamma &= \frac13 \left(1 + \sqrt[3]{\left(19 - 3 \sqrt{33}\right)} + \sqrt[3]{19 + 3 \sqrt{33}}\right) \\
    &\approx 1.8393
  \end{align}
$$

so, an ideal composition vector is given by 

$$ \dfrac{1}{1+\gamma+\gamma^2+\gamma^3}\left(1,\gamma,\gamma^2,\gamma^3\right) $$ 

which is stationary under the map, as expected. from here we can just scaled the composition vector, looking for its closest integer approximation, which is

$$ \vec{\phi} = \left(1655616,3045153,5600910,10301680\right). $$

running this through $f$ gets $f(\vec{\phi}) = 44.$

because of the first property, we can subtract the minimum entry from each component of the composition vector without changing $f,$ so the vector with minimum sum is 

$$ \vec{\phi} = \left(0,1389537,3945294,8646064\right). $$
