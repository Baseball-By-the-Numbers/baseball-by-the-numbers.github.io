## Solution

The magic of the problem is this: one horizontal polarizer would block all the light, polarizers do nothing but block light, yet a stack of many polarizers in front of the horizontal one will let a ton of light through.

### One polarizer

The polarization state of a photon is a vector we can look at from any perspective we like. To start, we can think of it in a basis of up and down, e.g. $\ket{\gamma} = \alpha\ket{\uparrow} + \beta\ket{\downarrow}.$ 

When the photon passes through a polarizer, the component that's perpendicular to the polarizer is extinguished.
