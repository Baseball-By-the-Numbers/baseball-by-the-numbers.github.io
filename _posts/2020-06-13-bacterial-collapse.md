>A bacterial colony starts from a single cell that has a probability $\gamma$ of splitting into $2$ and a probability $\left(1-\gamma\right)$ of lysing, as do all of its descendants. The strain in question is _Riddlerium classicum_, about which not much is known apart from its cataclysmic reproductive viability, $\gamma = 80\%$ (real bacteria are far more sucessful, Fig 4 in [Robust Growth of _Escherichia coli_](https://jun.ucsd.edu/files/publications/RobustGrowth_complete_CurrBiol2010.pdf)). What's the probability that the colony is blessed with everlasting propagation? (e.g. the population never crashes to zero)

## Solution

Before answering the main question, there's the issue of when the colony will be viable in the first place (nonzero probability to be everlasting, $P_\infty > 0$). 

The basic insight is that we need the expected number of cells in the next generation to be greater than $1$. In that case, the average outcome after one generation is that we have a solitary cell with the same existential crisis on its hands. 

So, if $\gamma < 1/2,$ we should expect $P_\infty = 0.$

### Colony flourishing

What if we want to go beyond the prayer of survival â€” how big does $\gamma$ need to be to push $P_\infty$ to whatever level we like? On first glance it seems like this could turn into a nested labyrinth of tracking the outcome for each branch of the lineage. 

However, each cell has the same prospects so the probability that the first cell leads to an everlasting colony is equal to the probability that either of its children leads to an everlasting colony. 

Symmetrically, the probability that the first cell leads to a finite colony is equal to the probability that it dies plus the probability that it reproduces, but both of its children's colonies spawn finite colonies.

`<hand drawing of second situation>`

Writing down the second of these, we get $P_\text{die} = (1-\gamma) + \gamma P_\text{die}^2.$

This can be solved with the quadratic equation but if we divide by $P_\text{die}$: 

$$1 = \frac{(1-\gamma)}{P_\text{die}} + \gamma P_\text{die}$$

it's a little easier to see that $P_\text{die} = \min(1, \left(1-\gamma\right)/\gamma).$

A colony either collapses or it doesn't, so $P_\infty = 1 - P_\text{die}$ and

$$\boxed{P_\infty = \max(0, \dfrac{2\gamma-1}{\gamma})}.$$

As we anticipated, there's no chance of an everlasting colony when $\gamma < 1/2.$ Also, if there's no chance of cell death, then there's no chance of colony collapse: $P_\infty(\gamma = 1) = 1.$

### So, what happens?

The colony from the problem has $\gamma = 0.8,$ so we expect that $P_\infty = \frac{2\times0.8 - 1}{0.8} = 75\%.$ The simulation is straightforward, and confirms that $P_\infty(\gamma = 80\%) = 75\%$. 

Simulating near the threshold is tricky because more trajectories will be on the fence between colony collapse and making it to the pantheon of everlasting colonies. If we cut the simulation off too early, e.g. by introducing a cutoff that's too high, then it will bias our estimate of $P_\infty$ to be too low (some colonies will be diddling under the threshold, before escaping). Likewise, if we introduce a low cutoff, it will look like there are everlasting colonies before the threshold. 

To get around this, we can use a high cutoff, but run all colonies until they either hit the cutoff or crash to zero. This would also allow us measure the false positive rate. 

```python

import random
import numpy as np

cutoff = 1000

def conduct_experiment(pp, start_count):
    cell_count = start_count

    # For 20 generations of growth
    for round in range(20):
        # For each cell, double with probability pp, lyse with probability (1 - pp)
        new_cells = sum((2 if random.random() < pp else 0) for cell in range(cell_count))
        # Update the cell count
        cell_count = new_cells
    # If the cell_count is bigger than cutoff, return the cell_count.
    if cell_count > cutoff:
        return(cell_count)
    # If it's 0 or less, return 0.
    elif cell_count <= 0:
        return(0)
    # Otherwise, keep running.
    else:
        return(conduct_experiment(pp, cell_count))
        
pp_values = np.arange(0, 1, 0.02)
Ps = []

for pp in pp_values:
    # Conduct 20000 experiments for each value of pp
    experiments = [conduct_experiment(pp, 1) for _ in range(200)]
    # Calculate Psurvive and accumulate
    Psurvive = np.mean([(1 if expt > 0 else 0) for expt in experiments])
    Ps.append(Psurvive)

```

Using the code above, we get good agreement with the calculation:
