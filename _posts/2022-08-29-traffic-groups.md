>**Question**:

>In the original puzzle, there were $N$ cars on a long, straight highway with a single lane. Each car traveled in the same direction but at a constant speed that was unique and randomly selected. However, if a driver caught up to another, slower car (or a group of cars similarly blocked by that slower car), they remained stuck behind that slower car.

>From the first car in the original lane to the last car, each decides whether to make the switch to the second lane as it passes. Fortunately, each car knows the speed of every other car, so each will make the switch provided that it can ultimately proceed at a greater speed (whether on its own or as part of a faster group).

## Solution

Each additional driver introduces an expected number of additional groups $\langle G_i\rangle$, making the total

$$\langle \text{num groups}\rangle_N = \langle G_1\rangle + \langle G_2\rangle + ... \langle G_N\rangle.$$

Now, the $i^\text{th}$ driver has a $1/i$ chance of being the $1^\text{st}$ fastest, or $2^\text{nd}$ fastest, all the way up to being the $i^\text{th}$ fastest driver.

If they are the first fastest, then they will only introduce a new group if all $(i-1)$ drivers before them are in increasing order. If they are $(i-1)$ fastest, they will only introduce a new group of the top $(i-2)$ drivers are in increasing order, and so on.

If those drivers weren't in increasing order, then at least one driver who is slower than them would have found it advantageous to switch lanes, meaning that both lanes already have a group moving slower than them, blocking them from making a new group at their own speed

So, 

$$\langle G_i\rangle = \frac{1}{i}\left[1 + 1 + 1/2! + ... 1/(i-1)!\right]$$

and

$$\langle\text{num groups}\rangle_N = \sum_{i=1}^N\frac1i\sum\limits_{j=0}^{i-1} \frac{1}{j!}.$$

Plotting this (gold) next to a $10^3$ round simulation (blue) shows good agreement:

In the high-$N$ limit, this converges to 

$$\langle\text{num groups}\rangle_N = H(N)e + O(1).$$

Plotting the approximation (dark gray) alongside the previous results shows good agreement at low $N$:
