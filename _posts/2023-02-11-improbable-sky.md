>**Question**: One cloudless night, the sky above you contains an equal number of visible stars and planes. Suddenly, you spot a point of light at a particular angle of elevation above the horizon. Based purely on this angle, you want to determine whether the point of light is more likely to be a star or a plane.

>- Stars are equally likely to be anywhere in the night sky.
>- Planes are equally likely to be flying anywhere over Earth (i.e., not just limited to established air routes) at an altitude of 6 miles. You can neglect takeoffs and landings.
>
>After some quick thinking, you realize that at this particular angle, the point of light is equally likely to be a star or a plane. What is this angle of elevation?

## Solution

on first thought, there doesn't seem to be a puzzle â€” the planes are spherically symmetric and so are the stars. what makes the difference?

the stars are spherically symmetric, in actuality and with respect to our perspective. the planes however are on a nearby sphere which means that, for the same angular increment, there are more planes at the horizon then there are when we look straight up.

to see this, we can just draw a sphere representing the uniform plane distribution. a patch of view, perpendicular to our line of sight, sweeps out a larger patch of the plane sphere whereas at the North pole, they are one and the same.

## calculation

with this intuition, we can go about calculating the probability distributions. 

### stars

first of all, the stars are uniform with respect to our perspective. if we gaze up from the horizon, stars are equally likely to be in any angular patch. since the stars are equally likely to be anywhere in our gaze, the uniform probability distribution is

$$ p_\text{stars}(\theta) = \frac{1}{2\pi}. $$

<!-- i.e. if we are just considering small patches of sky, we'd have a true uniform distribution $p(\theta,\phi) = 1/4\pi.$  -->

<!-- however, we have to account for the fact that when we look up at an angle $\theta$ to the horizon, we can look at any angle $\phi.$ this gives small angles of $\theta$ a larger circle of sky to intercept. the radius if proportional to $\cos\theta$ so -->

<!-- $$ p_\text{stars}(\theta) = \dfrac{\cos\theta}{\int\limits_0^{\frac12\pi}\cos\theta\,\text{d}\theta} = \cos\theta. $$ -->

once we have $p_\text{planes}(\theta),$ we'll check to see at what value of $\theta$ it overtakes $p_\text{stars}(\theta).$

### airplanes

with the planes, we have to account for the tilt of the surface of the airplane sphere relative to our line of sight, and the changing distance to the airplane sphere.

the probability of seeing a plane in a patch is proportional to its area. let's take some small angular extents $\Delta \theta$ and $\Delta \psi$ to define our patch.

looking at an angle $\theta$ from the horizontal, the extent in the $\theta$ direction is given by $\ell(\theta)\Delta \theta$ while the extent in the $\phi$ direction is $\ell(\theta)\cos\theta\Delta\phi,$ making the area of the patch

$$ dA = \left[l^2(\theta)\cos\theta\right]\Delta\theta\Delta\phi. $$

if the sphere of planes were always perpendicular to our patch, this would be it. however, away from the zenith, the tilt increases with $\theta.$

the surface of the sphere makes angle $\psi$ with our vision patch. as shown in the diagram, the tangent of this angle is 

$$ \tan\psi = \dfrac{dx}{dy}.$$ 

the surface of the sphere is defined by $y^2 = (R+h)^2 - x^2$ which gives $dx/dy = -y/x$ (sign not important). 

drawing the right triangle defined by $\ell(\theta)$ and extending a similar right triangle off the back, we can see that the angle between the sphere and our visual patch is $\alpha = \psi - \theta = \arctan\frac{x}{y} - \theta.$

we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $\theta$ through $x = \ell(\theta)\cos\theta$ and $y = R + \ell(\theta)\sin\theta.$

with all this taken into account, the effective area on the surface of the plane sphere occupied by a patch of vision at angle $\theta$ to the horizon is

$$ dA^\prime = \dfrac{\ell^2(\theta)\cos\theta}{\cos\alpha(\theta)}. $$

<!-- we can analyze the tilt by drawing a triangle. our vision patch is perpendicular to us and, so, makes angle $\theta$ with the corresponding patch on the sphere. that means our patch is a projection of the airplane patch at angle $\theta,$ so that $\text{d}A = \text{d}A^\prime/\cos\theta.$ -->

<!-- the length of the patch in the $\theta$-direction is just $\ell \Delta \theta,$ while the circumference of the strip is $2\pi\ell\cos\theta,$ making $dA = 2\pi\ell^2\cos\theta/\cos\theta = 2\pi\ell^2.$ -->

now $\ell$ is itself a function of $\theta,$ which we can find with the law of cosines, which for posterity, we can derive.

taking the sides to be vectors of lengths $R,$ $R+h,$ and $\ell,$ we have 

$$
  \begin{align}
    \lvert\vec{R}+\vec{h}\rvert^2 &= \left(\vec{\ell} + \vec{R}\right)\cdot\left(\vec{\ell} + \vec{R}\right) \\
    &= \ell^2 + R^2 + 2\ell R\cos\left(\tfrac12\pi - \theta\right)
  \end{align}
$$

which, after solving the quadratic for $\ell,$ gets 

$$ \ell(\theta) = \sqrt{h (h + 2 R) + R^2 \sin^2\theta} - R \sin\theta. $$

if the rude goldberg machine we constructed is correct, we should be able to integrate this over $\theta$ and $\phi$ to find the surface area of the portion of the plane sphere we can see. indeed, integrating $\ell^2 \cos\theta/cos\alpha$ over $\theta$ and $\phi$ we get $\approx 151023.64\ldots$ which matches the expectation from [$2\pi(R+h)h$](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCap.html)

with this in hand, we can find $p_\text{planes}(\theta):$

$$ p_\text{planes}(\theta) = \dfrac{\dfrac{\ell^2(\theta)\cos\theta}{\cos\alpha(\theta)}}{2\pi\int\limits_0^{\frac12\pi} \dfrac{\ell^2(\theta^\prime)\cos\theta^\prime}{\cos\alpha(\theta^\prime)}\,\text{d}\theta^\prime}. $$

now, we can plot $p_\text{plane}(\theta)$ to check when it crosses $1/2\pi.$ the effect of the tilt is to compress a very large amount of airplane sphere into vision patches near the horizon, so we should expect planes to be far more likely at the horizon, then taper off as we approach the zenith.

plotting the intersection, we find that the likelihood of a plan matches the likelihood of a star when $\theta \approx 0.10563$ or about $6.05$ degrees above the horizon.
