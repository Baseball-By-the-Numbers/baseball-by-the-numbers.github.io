>Consider a standard, two-player, 52-card game of War. If I start with just the four aces, and you start with all 48 other cards, randomly shuffled, what are your chances of winning?

## Solution

Rules for this game vary and are often incompletely specified. I will assume that cards played in a "war" are shuffled before being returned to the bottom of the deck of the player who wins them.

The Python code below does a ten-million-run Monte Carlo simulation of the game, and the percentages of victories for the all-aces player, assuming one, two, and three cards are played face-down in wars, respectively, are 80.9%, 71.7%, and 65.5%.

For the one-face-down-card version of the game, there is an interesting pattern in the frequencies of the possible game-lengths, where a game's length is its number of rounds, and where a round is considered to conclude when a player wins cards.

Inspection reveals that the chart columns for odd game lengths form a curve well below the higher curve formed by the even ones.  This means that even game-lengths are observed much more frequently (about five times as often) as odd game-lengths.  A good puzzle is: why should that be? Give it a think, or read on for (part of) the answer.

## Why

Say that a game after R completed rounds is an "even state" if R plus the number of cards in the loser's deck is even. All games start at an even state, and a game lasts an even number of rounds iff it ends in an even state. Non-war rounds preserve the evenness of the game-state, since R increases by 1 and the loser either gains or loses 1 card. And so do decided war-rounds, because R increases by 1 and the loser's cards increase or decrease by an odd number. Therefore a game can only exit an even state by the loser having one too few cards to play a battle (and thus losing the game). About 1 in 6 games end in that way, and only these games last oddly many rounds.

# Ten million reps take less than ten minutes when this
# is run with PyPy (much faster than stock Python).
Reps = 10000000

CardsDown = 1

# Play the next cards and break any ties. Return True if
# there are more cards to play.

				if len(YourDeck) < 1 + CardsDown:
					# And neither do you. Start the game from scratch.
					Rep -= 1
				GameResult = 2

			elif len(YourDeck) < 1 + CardsDown:

				# Play the tie-break, by first laying down the face-down
				# cards and then continuing the "while True" loop
				for _ in range(CardsDown):

	return (GameResult == 0)

# You have four of every number from 0 to 11, while I have just four 12s
YourCards = [n/4 for n in range(48)]
