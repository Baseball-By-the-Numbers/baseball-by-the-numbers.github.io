>Consider a standard, two-player, 52-card game of War. If I start with just the four aces, and you start with all 48 other cards, randomly shuffled, what are your chances of winning?

## Solution

Rules for this game vary and are often incompletely specified. I will assume that cards played in a "war" are shuffled before being returned to the bottom of the deck of the player who wins them.

The Python code below does a ten-million-run Monte Carlo simulation of the game, and the percentages of victories for the all-aces player, assuming one, two, and three cards are played face-down in wars, respectively, are 80.9%, 71.7%, and 65.5%.

For the once-face-down-card version of the game, there is an interesting pattern in the frequencies of the possible game-lengths, where a game's length is its number of rounds, and where a round is considered to conclude when a player wins cards.

Closer inspection reveals that even game-lengths are observed much more frequently (about five times as often) as odd game-lengths.  A good puzzle is: why? Give it a think, or read on for the answer.

## Why

Say that a non-terminal game-state after R completed rounds is an "even" state if R plus the number of cards in the loser's deck is even. All games start at an even game-state, and a game lasts an even number of rounds iff it ends in an even game-state. Non-war rounds preserve the evenness of the game-state, since R increases by 1 and the loser either gains or loses 1 card. And so do decided war-rounds, because R increases by 1 and the loser's cards increase or decrease by an odd number. Therefore a game can only exit an even state by the loser having one too few cards to play a battle (and thus losing the game). It seems that about 1 in 6 games end in that way (as we'll see, this proportion is highly dependent on the initial deal), and only these games last oddly many rounds.

## Comparison to Fair-Deal War

With a fair deal---each play gets half of a shuffled deck---the distribution looks very much like a log-normal distribution.  

![Probability of game lengths given a fair deal.](/img/GameOfWarFairVersusAces.png)

As you can see, the all-aces deal makes for much longer games on average (more than twice as long), and a far greater chance of extremely long games (look, for instance, at the tails of the distributions above 500 rounds).  It also, to my mind very surprisingly, changes the probability of an odd game-length from around 40% for a fair deal to about 17.5%---and interestingly, in both cases that probability is relatively independent of the length of the game, in that the probability of long games having odd length are not much different from that of medium and short games (the very shortest games are an exception). I wouldn't have been surprised to see a difference in the proportion of odd game lengths for short games, but I would have expected any difference of that sort to wash out in longer games as the decks get scrambled by play. There must be some structural feature of the all-aces deal that survives all the shuffling of war-winnings. If you have any idea what might explain this, please comment below!

To give a look at the distributions on a non-log scale:
