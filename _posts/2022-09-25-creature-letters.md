>**Question:** Graydon is about to depart on a boating expedition that seeks to catch footage of the rare aquatic creature, _F. Riddlerius_. Every day he is away, he will send a hand-written letter to his new best friend, David Hacker. But if Graydon still has not spotted the creature after $N$ days (where $N$ is some very, very large number), he will return home.
>
>Knowing the value of $N,$ Graydon confides to David there is only a $50\%$ chance of the expedition ending in success before the $N$ days have passed. But as soon as any footage is collected, he will immediately return home (after sending a letter that day, of course).
>
>On average, for what fraction of the $N$ days should David expect to receive a letter?
