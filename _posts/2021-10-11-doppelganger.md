The velocity of the doppelganger is $\left(\dot{x}, \dot{y}\right)$ and

$$ \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 = 2^2 $$

Moreover, they're always on the line $(t-x)/t \times 100\text{ ft}$

$$ y = 100\text{ ft} - 100\text{ ft}\frac{x}{t}. $$

So 

$$ yt = 100\text{ ft}\cdot t - 100\text{ ft}\cdot x \rightarrow y + t\dot{y} = 100\text{ ft}(1 - \dot{x}) $$

or

$$ \dot{x} = \left(100\text{ ft} - y - t\dot{y}\right)(100\text{ ft})^{-1} $$

so

$$ (100\text{ ft} - y - t\dot{y})^2 (100\text{ ft})^{-2} + \dot{y}^2 = 2^2 $$

Solving this for $\dot{y},$ we get an expression with a square root of $(2\text{ ft/s})^2t^2 - (y+100\text{ ft})(y-300\text{ ft})$ which shows that when $t$ is $0,$ $y$ has to be less than $300\text{ ft},$ or else there will be no possible solution for $\dot{y}.$  So, the furthest we can be when the line of sight is vertical is $y = 300\text{ ft}.$

Once we're there, we might be in a tricky spot. How fast do we need to move to stay on the line? To start, the vertical line at 300 ft is moving at $2 \text{ft/s}$ when it passes vertical. But how fast does the intercept at $y = 300\text{ ft}$ move in general? Again, since the doppelganger and the original make the same angle with the lamppost, the intercept at $y = 300\text{ ft}$ will always move at $2 \text{ ft/s}$ (since it is twice as far from the lamppost as the original, who has speed $1 \text{ ft/s}$), and so, the doppelganger can comfortably move horizontally once they reach $y=300\text{ ft}.$ 

They'll end up $200 \text{ ft}$ to the left of the origin, or a total of $\sqrt{(200\text{ ft})^2 + (200\text{ ft})^2} = 200\sqrt{2}\text{ ft}$ away from the original.
