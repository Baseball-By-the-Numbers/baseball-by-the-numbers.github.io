>You’re doing a $30$-minute workout on your stationary bike. There’s a live leaderboard that tracks your progress, along with the progress of everyone else who is currently riding, measured in units of energy called kilojoules. (For reference, one kilojoule is $1000$ Watt-seconds.) Once someone completes their ride, they are removed from the leaderboard.
>
>Suppose many riders are doing the 30-minute workout right now, and that they all begin at random times, with many starting before you and many starting after. Further suppose that they are burning kilojoules at different constant rates (i.e., everyone is riding at constant power) that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 200 Watts.
>
>Halfway through (i.e., $15$ minutes into) your workout, you notice that you’re exactly halfway up the leaderboard. How far up the leaderboard can you expect to be as you’re finishing your workout?
>
>As an added bonus problem (though not quite Extra Credit), what’s the highest up the leaderboard you could expect to be $15$ minutes into your workout?
>
>**Extra credit**

>Again, suppose there are many riders starting their $30$-minute workouts at random times, and that their powers are uniformly distributed between $0$ and $200$ Watts. Now, suppose you decide that you too will be pedaling with a random (but constant) power between $0$ and $200$ Watts.

>If you look down at the leaderboard at a random time during this random workout, how far up the leaderboard can you expect to be, on average?
