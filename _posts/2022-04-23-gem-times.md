## Solution

Thinking of the player's health like a particle, it can either move to the right (when the level-up succeeds) or to the left (when the level-up fails). Whichever happens, a gem is spent.

Call the number of gems a player will spend on the way from health level $j$ to level $5$ $\tau_j.$ 

Starting from health level $j,$ we can move to level $(j-1)$ with probability $p(j\rightarrow j-1)$ or to level $(j+1)$ with probability $p(j\rightarrow j+1).$ So, the expected value of $\tau_j$ is just $p(j,j-1)$ --- $p_{j,j-1}$

$$
  \tau_j = p(j\rightarrow j-1)\tau_{j-1} + p(j\rightarrow j+1)\tau_{j+1}
$$
