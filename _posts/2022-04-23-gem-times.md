## Solution

Thinking of the player's health like a particle, it can either move to the right (when the level-up succeeds) or to the left (when the level-up fails). Whichever happens, a gem is spent.

Call the number of gems a player will spend on the way from health level $j$ to level $5$ $\tau_j.$ 

Starting from health level $j,$ we can move to level $(j-1)$ with probability $p_{j,j-1}$ or to level $(j+1)$ with probability $p_{j, j+1}.$ So, the expected value of $\tau_j$ is just:

$$
  \tau_j = p_{j, j-1}(1 + \tau_{j-1}) + p_{j, j+1}(1 + \tau_{j+1})
$$

Since $j$ can only go to $(j-1)$ or $(j+1),$ we know that $p_{j,j-1} + p_{j,j+1} = 1,$ so this becomes

$$
  \tau_j = 1 + p_{j, j-1}\tau_{j-1} + p_{j, j+1}\tau_{j+1}
$$

Writing this out for the $6$ health levels, we get

$$
  \begin{align}
    \tau_0 &= 1 + \tau_1 \\
    \tau_1 &= 1 + p_{1,0}\tau_0 + p_{1,2}\tau_2 \\
    \tau_2 &= 1 + p_{2,1}\tau_1 + p_{2,3}\tau_3 \\
    &\vdots
    \tau_5 &= 0
  \end{align}
$$
