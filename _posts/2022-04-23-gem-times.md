## Solution

Thinking of the player's health like a particle, it can either move to the right (when the level-up succeeds) or to the left (when the level-up fails). Whichever happens, a gem is spent.

Call the number of gems a player will spend on the way from health level $j$ to level $5$ $\tau_j.$
