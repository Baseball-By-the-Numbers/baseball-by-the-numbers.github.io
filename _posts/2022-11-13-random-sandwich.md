>**Question**: I have made a square peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and now it’s time to slice it. But rather than making a standard horizontal or diagonal cut, I instead pick two random points along the perimeter of the sandwich and make a straight cut from one point to the other. (These points can be on the same side.)

>My slice is “reasonable” if I cut the square into two pieces and the smaller resulting piece has an area that is at least one-quarter of the whole area. What is the probability that my slice is reasonable?

## Solution

This problem is rooted in the geometry created by the slice, but to solve it we'll focus on the geometry of the parameter space — the plane defined by $a$ and $b,$ the positions along the sides where each cut is made.

If $a$ and $b$ are on adjacent sides, which happens $2/4$ of the time, then the smaller sandwich space is a right triangle of area $\frac12ab.$

Since we want the small piece to be "reasonable", we have

$$ \frac14 \leq \frac12 ab \leq \frac12. $$

The upper bound is only reachable at the point $(a,b) = (1,1),$ so we can focus on the lower bound. multiplying through by $2,$ we get $\frac12 \leq ab,$ or

$$ a\geq \frac{1}{2b}. $$

In the parameter space, this is a curve from the point $(1,\frac12)$ to $(\frac12, 1):$

The area under this curve is $\int\limits_0^1 \text{d}b\ a = \frac12 + \int\limits_{\frac12}^1 \frac{\text{d}b}{2b} = \frac12 + \frac{\log 2}{2}.$ 

The relevant area for "reasonable" small pieces is the complement, so the chance of a reasonable smaller triangle is $\frac12 - \frac12 \log 2.$

When $a$ and $b$ are on opposite sides, which happens the other $1/4$ of the time, the area is made up of a rectangle and a triangle. 

If $a > b,$ then the rectangle has area $1\times b$ and the triangle area is $\frac12 (a-b)\times 1,$ which makes $\dfrac12(a+b).$ When $b > a,$ the roles are reversed, but the expression is the same. 

We want the small piece to be "reasonable," so we're interested in values of $a$ and $b$ where $\dfrac14 \leq \dfrac12(a+b) \leq \dfrac34.$ This gives us two inequalities: $a \geq \frac12 - b$ and $a \leq \frac32 - b.$ Plotting them, they make a stripe of admissible values in the parameter space that goes diagonally down and to the right.

<!-- for every pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies this, there is a corresponding pair $(a^\prime, b^\prime) = (1-a, 1-b)$ that also satisfy it.  -->
The area of the stripe is just $1 - 2\times \frac18 = 3/4.$ 

Putting it all together, the total area contributing to $A_\text{min} \geq \frac14$ is 

$$ 
  \begin{align}
    P(A_\text{min}\geq \frac14) &= \frac24\left(\frac12 - \frac12\log 2\right) + \frac14\frac34 \\
    &= \frac{7}{16} - \frac{\log 2}{4} \\
    &\approx 0.2642 
  \end{align}
$$

almost a quarter of the time.
