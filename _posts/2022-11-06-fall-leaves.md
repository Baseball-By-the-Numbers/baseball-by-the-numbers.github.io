<!--more-->

We want to know the probability that a single tree will have its fall colors at time $t$, $P(\text{color at }t).$

The leaves can start changing at any time up until $t,$ so

$$ P(\text{color at }t) = \int\limits_0^t\text{d}t_\text{c} P(\text{color at }t\rvert t_\text{c})P(t_\text{c}).$$

<!-- For this to hold, the time of color change has to be less than $t,$ and the time of leaf fall has to be greater than $t:$ -->

<!-- $$t_\text{f} > t > t_\text{c}. $$ -->
