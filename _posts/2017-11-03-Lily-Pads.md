>A frog needs to jump across 20 lily pads. He starts on the shore (Number 0) and ends precisely on the last lily pad (Number 20). He can jump one or two lily pads at a time. How many different ways can he reach his destination?

>What if he can jump one, two or three at a time? Or four? Five? Six? Etc.

## Solution

Let $W(n,m)$ be the number of ways of traversing $n$ lily pads if you can jump up to $m$ at a time.

Then, $W(1,m) = 1$ and for $n>1$:

$$W(n,m) = \sum_{i=1}^{min(m,n-1)} W(i,m)$$

$W(20,2)$, the number of ways of traversing $20$ pads at most $2$ at a time, is $10,946$. If the frog can jump up to $20$ at a time, then there is a way of traversing for each subset of the $19$ intermediate pads he might land on, and so $2^19$, or $524,288$ ways in total.

```python
N = 20
W = {}
for m in range(1,N+1):
	W[(0,m)] = 1
for n in range(1,N+1):
	for m in range (1,N+1):
		W[(n,m)] = 0
		for i in range(max(0,n-m),n):
			W[(n,m)] += W[(i,m)]
print "Max Jump, Ways:"
for m in range(1,N+1):	
	print m,",", W[(N,m)]
```
