## Solution

### 1. The frog can jump one or two pads at a time.

There is just one way of traversing zero lily pads (stay on the shore), and just one of traversing a single pad: jump to it.

For any other number $n$ of pads, the number of ways of traversing $n$ pads is simply the sum of the numbers of ways of traversing $n-1$ and $n-2$ pads. That's because every way of traversing $n$ pads either starts with a jump to the first pad and is completed by a way of traversing $n-1$ more pads, or starts with a jump to the second pad and is completed by a way of traversing $n-2$ more.

So the sequence, for $n$ from $0$ to $20$, of the numbers of ways of traversing $n$ pads, is the start (or the start after the first element, if the first element is $0$) of the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number): $1,1,2,3,5,8, \ldots, 10946$. 

We can calculate that in $19$ simple two-integer sums, or we can use the following closed-form expression (if you find exponentiation to be an improvement over the very simple recurrence, which at least in this case is questionable):

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{21} - 
\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{21}\right]$$

### 2. The frog can jump from one to m pads at a time.

Let $W_m(n)$ be the number of ways of traversing $n$ lily pads, given that the frog can jump up to $m$ at a time.

For any $m$, $W_m(0) = 1$ and for $n>0$, $W_m(n)$ is the sum of $W_m(i)$, where $i$ ranges over the up-to-$m$ positive integers that precede $n$:

$$W_m(n) = \sum_{i=\max(0,n-m)}^{n-1} W_m(i)$$

This yields a generalization of the Fibonacci Sequence, known as the $n$-Step Fibonacci Sequence. The values of $W_m(20)$ are listed below.  As a sanity-check, we can verify that $W_{20}(20)$ is $2^{19}$, as it should be, because that's how many possible choices of stopping-pads there are on the way to the last lily pad.

### Code (Python)

```python
N = 20
W = {}
for m in range(1,N+1):
	W[(0,m)] = 1
for n in range(1,N+1):
	for m in range (1,N+1):
		W[(n,m)] = 0
		for i in range(max(0,n-m),n):
			W[(n,m)] += W[(i,m)]
print "Max Jump, Ways:"
for m in range(1,N+1):	
	print m,",", W[(N,m)]
```

Output:

```
Max Jump, Ways:
1 , 1
2 , 10946
3 , 121415
4 , 283953
