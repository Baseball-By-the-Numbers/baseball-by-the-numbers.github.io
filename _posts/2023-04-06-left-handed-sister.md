## Solution

we want to know if the person we saw is some guy, or "the guy". the question is, how much should we increase our credence in "the guy" on the basis of hearing about his second sister.

before we hear, our relative belief is

$$
  \dfrac{P(\text{the guy}\rvert \text{sister Mary})}{P(\text{some guy}\rvert \text{sister Mary})}
$$

and after we hear about the lefty sister, it becomes

$$
  \dfrac{P(\text{the guy}\rvert \text{sister Mary, lefty sister})}{P(\text{some guy}\rvert \text{sister Mary, lefty sister})}
$$
