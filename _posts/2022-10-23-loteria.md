## Solution

There are four ways to win the Loteria

- cards on the $4$ corners
- a row of $4$ cards
- a column of $4$ cards
- a $2\times2$ square of cards.

If we're to win on the $5^\textrm{th}$ round, we have to be one card placement away from winning on the $4^\textrm{th}$ round. With only $4$ cards drawn, these outcomes are independent, since only one winning pattern can result with $5$ cards in play. 

So, we have

$$
  \begin{align}
    N(\text{win on }5^\textrm{th}\text{ draw}) &= N(\text{corners }\mathbf{ OR }\text{ row }\mathbf{ OR }\text{ column }\mathbf{ OR }\text{ square}) \\
    &= N(\text{corners}) + N(\text{row}) + N(\text{column}) + N(\text{square})
  \end{align}
$$

There is

- $1$ way to place the corners, with $4$ ways to leave one out.,
- $4$ ways to place the rows, with $4$ ways to leave one out,
- $4$ ways to place the columns, with $4$ ways to leave one out, and
- $9$ ways to place the squares, with $4$ ways to leave one out.

There are also $T - (m-1) - 1)$ places to put the card that's left out of the almost-winning pattern.

Generalizing, this makes $N(m) = (4 + m^2 + m^2 + 4(m-1)^2)\times(T-m)$ ways to be $1$ card from a win after the $4^\text{th}$ draw.

The total number of ways to place the $4$ cards without winning is the total number of ways to place $4$ cards out of $T$ total locations, less the number of ways to win in $4$ draws = $\binom{T}{4} - (1 + 2m + (m-1)^2).$

So, the probability of being one card placement away from a win after $4$ cards is 

$$
  \begin{align}
    P(\text{poised to win after 4}) &= \dfrac{N(m)}{N_\text{total}(\text{no win})} \\
    &= \dfrac{(4 + m^2 + m^2 + 4(m-1)^2)\times(T-m)}{\dbinom{T}{4} - (1 + 2m + (m-1)^2)}
  \end{align}
$$

The overall probability to win on the $5^\text{th}$ draw is the probability to be poised to win after the $4^\text{th}$ draw times the probability of correctly placing the $5^\text{th}$ card. As there is $1$ correct position and $(T-4)$ positions remaining, this is

$$
P(\text{win on }5^\text{th}\rvert\text{no win by }4^\text{th}) = \dfrac{(4 + m^2 + m^2 + 4(m-1)^2)\times(T-m)}{\dbinom{T}{4} - (1 + 2m + (m-1)^2)}\frac{1}{T-4}
$$

The prediction for the case at hand is $P(\text{win on }5^\text{th}\rvert\text{no win by }4^\text{th}) = 8/35137 \approx 0.00022768022.$ 

Setting $m=4$ and varying $T,$ we can plot the prediction against a simulation.

It looks pretty good.

Since each Loteria board is independent, the probability of a single winner on the $5^\text{th}$ draw is

$$
  1000 P(\text{win on }5^\text{th}\rvert\text{no win by }4^\text{th}) (1-P(\text{win on }5^\text{th}\rvert\text{no win by }4^\text{th}))^999 \approx 0.181356
$$
