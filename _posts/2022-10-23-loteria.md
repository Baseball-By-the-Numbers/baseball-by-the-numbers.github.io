## Solution

There are four ways to win the Loteria

- cards on the $4$ corners
- a row of $4$ cards
- a column of $4$ cards
- a $2\times2$ square of cards.

With only $4$ cards drawn, these outcomes are independent, since only one of them can result on the next draw. So, we have

$$
  \begin{align}
    P(\text{win on }5^\textrm{th}\text{ draw}) &= P(\text{corners}\mathbf{OR}\text{row}\mathbf{OR}\text{column}\mathbf{OR}\text{square}) \\
    &= P(\text{corners}) + P(\text{row}) + P(\text{column}) + P(\text{square})
  \end{align}
$$
