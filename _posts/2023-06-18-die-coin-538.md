## Solution

we can get the expected number of rolls by accounting for all the ways we can reach the end condition. 

### Die

for the die, we can either

- immediately repeat the first die, or
- not repeat the first die. in this case we restart the process with a roll under our belt.

so, if $T$ is the number of rolls after the first, we get

$$ T = p + (1 - p)(1 + T) = 1 + (1 - p) T $$

which leads to $T = 1/p$ and, restoring the first roll, the total expected rolls for a double is $T^\prime = 1 + 1/p  = 7.$

### Coin 

for the coin, we can 

- immediately proceed to the same side three times in a row, or
- get the same side two times in a row, before switching and restarting the game, or
- immediately switch sides, and restart the game.

if $T$ is the number of rolls required after the first, we get

$$ T = 2p^2 + p(1 - p)(2 + T) + (1 - p)(1 + T)$$

which leads to $T = (1 + p)/p^2 = 6$ and the total expected rolls for a triple is $T^\prime = 6 + 1 = 7.$

surprisingly, they have the same expectation.

### Who wins?

to evaluate the race of die rolling and coin flipping, we need to find the distribution of finish times for either medium.

the die is straightforward, every roll after the first has probability $(1-p)$ to not repeat, and probability $p$ to repeat. so, the probability that the die finishes on roll $\ell$ is simply 

$$ P(\text{die in}\, \ell) = (1-p)^{\ell-2}p. $$

for the coin, there are more interesting dynamics. if we find ourselves in a restarted game at time $t$ it is because we restarted immediately at time $(t-1)$ or because we got two in a row, and then reset at $(t-1).$

by contrast, we can find ourself with two repeats at time $t$ only if we were in a restarted game at time $(t-1).$

finally, if we finish the game at time $t$ it means we had two in a row at time $(t-1).$

putting this together, we get the transformation

$$ \left(\begin{array}{c}p_1(t) \\ p_2(t) \\ p_3(t)\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{ccc} (1-p) & (1-p) & 0 \\ p & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & p& 0\end{array}\right)\cdot \left(\begin{array}{c}p_1(t-1) \\ p_2(t-1) \\ p_3(t-1)\end{array}\right) $$

we can diagonalize this matrix so that

$$ \vec{P}_t = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{P}^{-1}\vec{P}_{t-1} $$

by placing the eigenvectors as the columns of $\mathbf{P}$ 

$$ \left[\begin{matrix}0 & \frac{p \left(1 - p\right) + \frac{\left(p - 1\right) \left(p + \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} - 1\right)}{2}}{p^{2}} & \frac{p \left(1 - p\right) - \frac{\left(p - 1\right) \left(- p + \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} + 1\right)}{2}}{p^{2}}\\0 & \frac{- p - \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} + 1}{2 p} & \frac{- p + \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} + 1}{2 p}\\1 & 1 & 1\end{matrix}\right] $$

and the eigenvalues as the diagonal entries of $\mathbf{D}:$

$$ \left[\begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 0\\0 & - \frac{p}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} & 0\\0 & 0 & - \frac{p}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\right]. $$
