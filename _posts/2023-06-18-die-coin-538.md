>**Question**: With The Riddler nearing its end here at FiveThirtyEight, I can finally get something off my chest: Starting a competition with the flip of a coin (say, to determine possession of a ball) is so boring!
>
>Instead, let’s give the captain of one team a fair coin and the captain of the other team a fair die. The captain with the coin will flip it at the same time the other captain rolls the die. They continue doing this until the coin is the same (whether heads or tails) for three consecutive flips or the number that comes face-up on the die is the same for two consecutive rolls.
>
>On average, how many coin flips will it take to get three in a row? And how many die rolls will it take to get two in a row?
>
>**Extra credit**: While the numbers of flips and rolls may often be the same, which team — the team with the coin or the team with the die — is more likely to win the toss/roll? (That is, which is more likely to happen sooner?)
