## Solution

We can get the expected number of rolls by accounting for all the ways we can reach the end condition. 

### Die

For the die, we can either

- immediately repeat the first die, or
- not repeat the first die.

In the second case we restart the process with a roll under our belt. So, if $T_\text{die}$ is the number of rolls after the first, we get

$$ 
   \begin{align}
    T_\text{die} &= p + (1 - p)(1 + T_\text{die}) \\
                 &= 1 + (1 - p) T_\text{die} 
   \end{align}
$$

which leads to $T_\text{die} = 1/p$ and, restoring the first roll, the expected number of rolls to observe a repeat is $T_\text{die}^\prime = 1 + 1/p  = 7.$

### Coin 

For the coin, we can 

- immediately proceed to the same side three times in a row, or
- get the same side two times in a row, then restart the game, or
- immediately restart the game.

If $T_\text{coin}$ is the number of rolls required after the first, we get

$$ T_\text{coin} = 2p^2 + p(1 - p)(2 + T_\text{coin}) + (1 - p)(1 + T_\text{coin})$$

which leads to $T_\text{coin} = (1 + p)/p^2 = 6$ and the expected number of rolls to observe three in a row is $T_\text{coin}^\prime = 6 + 1 = 7.$

Surprisingly, these have the same expectation.

### Who wins?

To evaluate the race between die rolling and coin flipping, we need to find the distribution of finish times for either medium.

The die is straightforward, every roll after the first has probability $(1-p)$ to not repeat, and probability $p$ to repeat. so, the probability that the die finishes on roll $t$ is simply 

$$ P^\text{die}_2(t) = (1-p)^{t-2}p. $$

For the coin, there are more interesting dynamics. If we find ourselves in a restarted game at time $t$ it is because we either restarted immediately at time $(t-1)$ or because we got two in a row, and then reset at $(t-1).$

By contrast, we can only find ourself with two repeats at time $t$ if we were in a restarted game at time $(t-1).$

Finally, if we finish the game at time $t$ it means that we had two in a row at time $(t-1).$ Putting this together, we get the transformation

$$ \left(\begin{array}{c}P_1(t) \\ P_2(t) \\ P_3(t)\end{array}\right) = \overbrace{\left(\begin{array}{ccc} (1-p) & (1-p) & 0 \\ p & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & p& 0\end{array}\right)}^\mathbf{M} \cdot \left(\begin{array}{c} P_{1}(t-1) \\ P_{2}(t-1) \\ P_{3}(t-1)\end{array}\right) $$

We can diagonalize this matrix so that

$$ \mathbf{P}(t) = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{D}\mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{P}(t-1) $$

by placing the eigenvectors as the columns of $\mathbf{T}$ 

$$ \mathbf{T} = \left(\begin{matrix}0 & \frac{p \left(1 - p\right) + \frac{\left(p - 1\right) \left(p + \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} - 1\right)}{2}}{p^{2}} & \frac{p \left(1 - p\right) - \frac{\left(p - 1\right) \left(- p + \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} + 1\right)}{2}}{p^{2}}\\ 0 & \frac{- p - \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} + 1}{2 p} & \frac{- p + \sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)} + 1}{2 p}\\ 1 & 1 & 1\end{matrix}\right) $$

and the eigenvalues as the entries of $\mathbf{D}:$

$$ \mathbf{D} = \left(\begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & - \frac{p}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} & 0\\ 0 & 0 & - \frac{p}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{- \left(p - 1\right) \left(3 p + 1\right)}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}\right). $$

This representation makes it straightforward to generate the occupation of states $1,2,$ and $3$ over time by raising the entries of $\mathbf{D}$ to the power $t.$ 

$$ \mathbf{P}(t) = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{D}^{t-1}\mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{P}(1) $$

Setting $\mathbf{P}(1)$ to $\left(1,0,0\right)^\top$ and dotting the result with $\left(0,0,1\right),$ we can extract $P_3(t).$

Plotting them on the same axes, we see state $1$ deplete into state $2$ and then state $3$ (the coin spends one time step in state 3 before being removed from the system):

### Head to head

With $P^\text{coin}_3(t)$ and $P^\text{die}_2(t)$ in hand, we can calculate the probability that the die roller beats the coin flipper.

The die roller wins if they reach $2$ of the same side in the row before the coin reaches three in a row. In other words,

$$ 
    \begin{align}
    P(\text{die wins}) &= P_2^\text{die}(2)\left[P_3^\text{coin}(3) + P_3^\text{coin}(4) + P_3^\text{coin}(5) + \ldots\right] \\ 
    &\, + P_2^\text{die}(3)\left[P_3^\text{coin}(4) + P_3^\text{coin}(5) + P_3^\text{coin}(6) + \ldots\right] + \ldots \\
    &= \sum\limits_{i=2}^\infty \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^\infty P_2^\text{die}(i)P_3^\text{coin}(j) \\
    &= \sum\limits_{i=2}^\infty P_2^\text{die}(i) \left[1 - \sum\limits_{j=3}^i P_3^\text{coin}(j)\right]
    \end{align}
$$

Which comes out to approximately $ P(\text{die win}) \approx 0.491525\ldots$, which compares favorably with the $N = 10^8$ run estimate $\hat{P}(\text{die win}) \approx 0.491498\ldots$

We can also evaluate the likelihood that the coin wins through

$$ P(\text{coin wins}) = \sum\limits_{i=3}^\infty \sum\limits_{j=i+1}^\infty P_3^\text{coin}(i)P_2^\text{die}(j) \approx 0.423729\ldots $$

Finally, we can get the likelihood of a tie by summing $\sum\limits_{i=3}^\infty P_3^\text{coin}(i)P_2^\text{die}(i) \approx 0.0847458\ldots$
