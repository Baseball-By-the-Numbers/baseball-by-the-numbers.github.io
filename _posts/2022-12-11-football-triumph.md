## Solution

any of the $4$ players can end up on top and to do it they have to win their bracket, followed by the championship. take player A for example, to triumph they need to first defeat player D and then win the championship which would be against player B or player C. this means 

$$ P(\text{player A wins it all}) = P(\text{player A wins bracket})\left[P(\text{player B wins bracket})P(\text{player A beats player B}) + P(\text{player C wins bracket})P(\text{player A beats player C})\right] $$
