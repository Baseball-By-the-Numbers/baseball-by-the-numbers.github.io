>**Question**: Consider 3-space (i.e. $\mathbb{R}^3$) partitioned into a grid of unit cubes with faces defined by the planes of all points with at least one integer coordinate. For a fixed positive real number $\ell$, a random line segment of length $\ell$ (chosen uniformly in location and orientation) is placed in this cubic lattice.
>
>What length $\ell$ maximizes the probability that the endpoints of the segment lie in orthogonally adjacent unit cubes (that is, the segment crosses exactly one integer-coordinate plane), and what is this maximal probability?

## Solution

the rod forms the diagonal of a rectangular prism. the prism crosses cell boundaries when the rod does. 



calling $\theta$ the angle from the $x$-axis and $phi$ the angle from the $z$-axis,
