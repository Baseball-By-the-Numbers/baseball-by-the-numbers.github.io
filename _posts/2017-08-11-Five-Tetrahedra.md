>Fans of Dungeons & Dragons will have fond feelings for four-sided dice, which are shaped like regular tetrahedrons. Some might have noticed, in those long hours of fantasy battle, that if you touch five of these pyramids face-to-face-to-face, they come agonizingly close to forming a closed pentagon. Alas, there remains a tiny angle of empty space left between two of the pyramids. What is the measure of that angle?

## Solution

First we determine the _dihedral angle_ (labeled $\theta$ in the diagrams) between faces of a regular tetrahedron:

$$\frac{\theta}{2} = \arcsin{\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$$

$$\theta = 2\arcsin{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}} \approx 70.53^\circ$$

The five tetrahedra together take up five times that angle, and so what's left over is:

$$ 360 - 5 \times \theta \approx 7.356^\circ$$
