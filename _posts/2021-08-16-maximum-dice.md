## Solution

It's clear that if we get a good result early, like an extra $6,$ then we should opportunistically freeze it. The tricky decision is whether to freeze a middle-of-the-road result like a $5.$

It helps to think about what we'd do with many or few die. 

### Many

If, somehow, we rolled one hundred die and only got one $6,$ it would be overwhelmingly likely that on the next roll, we get a bunch of $6$s, so it would make sense to re-roll all but the $6.$

### Few

On the other hand, if we rolled two die and got $\\{4,4\\},$ it would make sense to freeze both $4$s since the expected value of a re-roll is just $\frac72.$ 

## The best strategy

To make the best decisions, we simply need to make the best decisions. 

If we roll five die and get $d_1 \geq d_2 \geq d_3 \geq d_4 \geq d_5,$ then we could

- Choice 1: keep $d_1$ and re-roll four die
- Choice 2: keep $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ and re-roll three die
- Choice 3: keep $\\{d_1, d_2, d_3\\}$ and re-roll two die
- Choice 4: keep $\\{d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4\\}$ and re-roll one die
- Choice 5: keep all five die and the game is over.

If $\langle S_n \rangle$ is the expected value of rolling $n$ die, then the expected value of each of these choices are

- $d_1 + \langle S_4 \rangle$
- $d_1 + d_2 + \langle S_3 \rangle$
- $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + \langle S_2 \rangle$
- $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + \langle S_1 \rangle$
- $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5$

Which choice should we make? Whichever has the highest value. 

The value of $\langle S_5\rangle$ is the average value of this maximization over all possible sets $\\{d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4. d_5\\}.$

In general

$$
\langle S_n \rangle = \langle \max\{u=1}^n \langle S_{n-u}\rangle + \sum\limits_{j=1}^u d_j \rangle_{d_1,\ldots,d_n}
$$

## Organizing the calculation

Evidently, we need the values of $\langle S_1\rangle$ through $\langle S_{n-1}\rangle$ before we can calculate $\langle S_n\rangle.$

We can build up the calculations in order, first treating all the one die cases, then all two die cases, then all three die cases, and so on.

```python
import random
import itertools
from fractions import Fraction

expected_scores = [0]

def SN(n):
    total = 0
    for roll in itertools.product(range(1, 6 + 1), repeat=n):
        roll = list(roll)
        roll.sort()
        total += max(sum(roll[m:]) + expected_scores[m] for m in range(0, n)) 
    return(Fraction(total , 6 ** n))

for num_die in range(1, 9 + 1):
    expected_scores.append(SN(num_die))
```

Running the code, we get the following expected scores under the optimal strategy:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c}\hline
\text{Case} & \text{Optimal score} \\
\langle S_1\rangle & \frac{7}{2} \approx3.5 \\
\langle S_2\rangle & \frac{593}{72} \approx 8.236 \\
\langle S_3\rangle & \frac{13049}{972} \approx 13.425 \\
\langle S_4\rangle & \frac{989065}{52488} \approx 18.844 \\
\langle S_5\rangle & \frac{1108166095}{45349632} \approx 24.436 \\
\langle S_6\rangle & \frac{332273594663}{11019960576} \approx 30.152 \\
\langle S_7\rangle & \frac{4621176159903031}{128536820158464} \approx 35.952 \\
\langle S_8\rangle & \frac{9026399212157210195951}{215892499727278669824} \approx 41.810 \\ 
\langle S_9\rangle & \frac{51897773343582111932203623017}{1087849490465798670885322752} \approx 47.707
\end{array}
$$
