## Solution

The reason we don't see the Moon during the day because it's on the other side of the Earth. The Moon takes $\sim 30$ days to orbit Earth, so we are effectively sampling it once a day throughout its orbit. 

The reason we see the Moon at night is that it's illuminated by the Sun. Since the Moon's orbital plane isn't the the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun, sunlight fully illuminates one side of the Moon.

The reason that Moon's shape seems to change throughout the month is that its illuminated half changes the angle it makes with Earth.
