## Solution

At first I solved the $4$-piece case with a cobbled-together multivariable integral, to get $\langle\ell\rangle = 15/32$, I expected the $N$-piece case to involve sums of compound integrals and was going to leave it alone. However, in light of compelling empirical results from [Goh Pi Han](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fp7Dku78OgxM0KhSbRMFubCFIaAUDCKt?usp=sharing), we were inspired to look for a simple perspective.

The approach is to find the probability distribution for the length of the shard that includes the $\text{6 inch}$ mark ($x=1/2$ for the purpose of this solution). The main insight is that for a length $\ell$ interval to cover the point $1/2,$ all we need is that two points are a distance $\ell$ apart and that no other points interrupt that interval (or else it would become a covering interval of length $\ell^\prime < \ell$).

### Does it cover?

The first non-trivial issue here is the probability that a random interval of length $\ell$ will cover the point $1/2.$ 

First of all, if $\ell \geq 1/2,$ then this probability is $1$ â€” there's no way to place an interval of length $\ell > 1/2$ without encompassing the middle of the ruler. So, whatever expression we find, we expect it to equal $1$ when $\ell = 1/2.$

For a ruler of length $\ell,$ the total length of the region where we can place the shard's leftmost point is $\left(1-\ell\right)$ (we can't place it any further, or its rightmost point would include points not on the original ruler). And if the shard's leftmost point starts more than a distance $\ell$ away, it won't reach $1/2.$ 

So, the probability that a random shard of length $\ell$ covers the halfway point is $P_\text{cover} = \ell/(1-\ell),$ which equals $1$ when $\ell = 1/2,$ as we had hoped. To summarize,

$$P_\text{cover}(\ell)=\begin{cases}
\dfrac{\ell}{1-\ell} & \text{when } \ell \lt 1/2 \\
1 & \text{when } \ell \geq 1/2.
\end{cases}$$

### Cases

There are two umbrella cases:

- where the shard is formed from two points where the ruler has broken. When $\ell < 1/2$, this is the only way for the shard to form. 
- when $\ell \geq 1/2$ it becomes possible for the shard to stretch all the way from an original endpoint of the ruler (say the $0\text{ inch}$ mark) past $1/2.$ 

### Two breakpoints

The first case involves several things: **a**. the random interval has to contain $1/2,$ **b**. no points can be within $\ell$ of the left end of the shard, **c**. the right end of the shard has to be a distance $\ell$ from the left end, **d**. the number of ways we can pick $2$ endpoints out of the $n$ breakpoints $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}.$

Parts **a** and **b** contribute $P_\text{cover}(\ell)\times \left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1}.$ Part **d** contributes $2\times\binom{N}{2}$ (the $2$ because $x_i$ on the left with $x_j$ on the right is distinct from the reverse). Part **c** is a bit tricky. The first and last point have to be chosen a distance $\ell$ apart. However, each point is a random draw of uniform probability. As we've already ensured that the other $\left(n-1\right)$ points are a distance of at least $\ell$ from the first, this factor is just $1.$

In total, the distribution of lengths $\ell$ for a shard with two breakpoints for ends is 

$$P_2(\ell) = 2\binom{n}{2}P_\text{cover}(\ell)\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1}.$$

### One breakpoint

For the case where only one end of the shard is a breakpoint, the calculation is straightforward. The first point is picked with uniform probability, all $\left(n-1\right)$ remaining points have to be picked outside of the interval $\left[0,x\right),$ and there are $\binom{N}{1}$ ways to select the first point. Since there's a symmetric set of cases when the unbroken endpoint is at the $\text{12 inch}$ mark, we multiply by $2$. Since such a shard must have $\ell\geq 1/2$, there is $100\%$ chance for this shard to cover $1/2.$ 

Putting it all together, the one breakpoint shard's distribution is 

$$P_1(\ell) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{when } \ell \lt 1/2 \\
2\binom{n}{1}\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1} & \text{when } \ell \geq 1/2.
\end{cases}$$

### Complete pdf

With these two cases in hand, the overall pdf is just $P_\text{total}(\ell) = P_1(\ell) + P_2(\ell)$ which has a jump discontinuity at $\ell=1/2$. When $\ell<1/2$ there's just the two-breakpoint shard, and

$$
\begin{align}
P_\text{total}(\ell) &= 2\binom{n}{2}P_\text{cover}(\ell)\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1} \\
&= 2\binom{n}{2}\frac{\ell}{1-\ell}\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1} \\
&= 2\binom{n}{2}\ell\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-2}
\end{align}
$$

When $\ell \geq 1/2,$ both kinds of shard are possible and (with $P_\text{cover}(\ell) = 1$ when $\ell > 1/2$), we have

$$
\begin{align}
P_\text{total}(\ell) &= 2\binom{n}{2}\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1} + 2\binom{N}{1}\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1} \\
&= 2\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1}\left[\binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2}\right] \\
&= 2\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1}\binom{n+1}{2}
\end{align}
$$

So

$$P_\text{total}(\ell) = 
\begin{cases}
2\binom{n}{2}\ell\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-2} & \text{when } \ell \lt 1/2 \\
2\binom{n+1}{2}\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1} & \text{when } \ell \geq 1/2
\end{cases}
$$

Plotting this against an empirical pdf with $N=10\, 000$ points, it looks pretty good:

### Expected shard length

With the pdf in hand, we can find $\langle\ell\rangle$ by integration:

$$\begin{align}
\langle\ell\rangle &= \int\limits_0^\ell d\ell\, \ell \times P_\text{total}(\ell) \\
&= 2\binom{n}{2}\int\limits_0^{1/2} d\ell\, \ell^2 \left(1-\ell\right)^{n-2} + 2\binom{n+1}{2}\int\limits_{1/2}^1 d\ell\, \ell\left(1-\ell\right)^{n-1}
\end{align}
$$

which comes out to the absolutely miraculous

$$\boxed{\langle\ell\rangle = \frac{2-2^{-n}}{n+1}}.$$

Plugging in the values of $n,$ we find the expected lengths for the first few number of breakpoints, reproducing $15/32$ for $n=4$ breaks, as we expect:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline
 n & \langle\ell\rangle \\ \hline
 0 & 1 \\
 1 & \frac{3}{4} \\
 2 & \frac{7}{12} \\
 3 & \frac{15}{32} \\
 4 & \frac{31}{80} \\
 5 & \frac{21}{64} \\
 6 & \frac{127}{448} \\
 7 & \frac{255}{1024} \\
 8 & \frac{511}{2304} \\
 9 & \frac{1023}{5120} \\
 10 & \frac{2047}{11264} \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$
