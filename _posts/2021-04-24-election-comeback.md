## Solution

The trick we're interested in is for the loser on election night to go on to be the winner when all is said and done. For the case at hand, this means that, on election night, a candidate has less than $\frac12 n_1$ (half of the votes), but gets enough in the mail-ins to end up with over half of the total votes (more than $\frac12 (n_1 + n_2)$). 

$$ P(\text{less than half on election night, but majority overall}) $$

The greatest number of votes the election night loser can get, yet still go on to win is one less than half the votes counted on election night ($\frac12 n_1 - 1$). Similarly, the the greatest number of votes that can get is $1$ less than half the total number of votes ($\frac12 (n_1 + n_2) - 1.$
