## Solution

first, we'll analyze the large deck limit, then we'll find the exact probability for two $52$ card decks.

### large deck limit

as the deck gets large the probability $P(\text{no collisions})$ will tend to $1/\sqrt{e}\approx 0.60653\ldots$

to see this, let's build the game one pair of draws at a time. with $N$ cards in each deck, the probability that the first pair doesn't collide is $(2N-2)/(2N-1)$ which can be written as

$$ \left(1 - \frac{1}{2N-1}\right). $$

the probability there is no collision on the second is likewise $(2N-4)/(2N-3)$ which can be written as 

$$ \left(1 - \frac{1}{2N-3}\right). $$

and so on. as $N$ goes to infinity, all $N$ of these factors are approximately $(1-1/2N)$ and so the overall probability to win is

$$ P(\text{no collisions}) \approx \left(1-\frac{1}{2N}\right)^N $$

which goes to 

$$ 1/\sqrt{e}. $$

### $52$ card decks

we can find the exact probability through recursion. 

call a "type" any of the $N=52$ cards in the deck and call $P(s,d)$ the probability that the game has no collisions given that there are currently $s$ types where one of the two cards has been drawn and $d$ types where neither of the cards have been drawn.

if we are in state $(s,d)$ we can either form the next pair from

- two singlets, moving to state $(s-2, d)$
- a singlet and a doublet, moving to state $(s, d-1)$ (one singlet goes away, but one is formed from the doublet)
- two doublets, moving to state $(s+2, d-2)$

so, the probability that the $(s,d)$ game results in no collisions is 

$$ P(s,d) = \frac{s(s-1)}{(2d+s)(2d+s-1)}P(s-2,d) + \frac{sd}{(2d+s)(2d+s-1)}P(s,d-1) + \frac{2d(2d-2)}{(2d+s)(2d+s-1)}P(s+2,d-2). $$

running this recursion in python, we get 

$$ \begin{align}
    P(0,52) &= \frac{335561727225862936774353972738829595013743745454800896090990716254443717947031552}{555926557447585078813889409645210912590669690718980253197612210789777133544921875} \\
    &\approx 0.60361\ldots 
  \end{align} 
$$

we can also try to approximate the infinite limit, evaluating for an $N=10000$ deck gets $P(0, 10^4) \approx 0.60652$ which is very close to $1/\sqrt{e}\approx 0.60653\ldots $

```python
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
from functools import lru_cache
from fractions import Fraction as F

@lru_cache(maxsize=10 ** 7)
def P(s, d):

  denom = (2 * d + s) * (2 * d + s - 1)
  
  if s < 0 or d < 0:
    return 0
  
  if s == 0 and d == 0:
    return 1
  
  else:
    return F( s * (s - 1) * P(s - 2, d) \
             + 2 * s * (2 * d) * P(s, d - 1) \
             + (2 * d) * (2 * d - 2) * P(s + 2, d - 2) \
           , denom )
```
