You and your friend both have standard decks of $52$ cards. First, you combine them into a single deck with $104$ cards, and you thoroughly shuffle it. Then, you randomly split this back into two decks with $52$ cards eachâ€”one for you, and one for your friend.

Each of you draw one card at a time. If the two of you can make it through your entire decks without ever drawing the same card at the same time, you both win. Otherwise, you both lose.

What is the probability that you and your friend will win this collaborative game?
