title: Pass the Cranberry Sauce

>**Question**: it's Thanksgiving and your family is gathered 'round the circular dinner table, Tofurkey in the middle, as is tradition. When the time comes, your Aunt Riddla brings out her famous cranberry sauce, handing it to you to place on the table. Wherever you place it, the person sitting there will take some sauce and then pass it randomly to one of their neighbors with probability $r$ to the right, and probability $\ell$ to the left. 

This placement is no small decision though. You want to punish your naughty Uncle Zach so that he gets the cranberry sauce last! Where should you start the sauce off on its journey if you want Uncle Zach to be the most likely to be the last person to get that famous cranberry sauce?
