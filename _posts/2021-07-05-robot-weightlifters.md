>**Question**: The Robot Weightlifting World Championshipâ€™s final round is about to begin! Three robots, seeded 1, 2, and 3, remain in contention. They take turns from the 3rd seed to the 1st seed publicly declaring exactly how much weight (any nonnegative real number) they will attempt to lift, and no robot can choose exactly the same amount as a previous robot. Once the three weights have been announced, the robots attempt their lifts, and the robot that successfully lifts the most weight is the winner. If all robots fail, they just repeat the same lift amounts until at least one succeeds.
>
>Assume the following:
>
>1. all the robots have the same probability $p(w)$ of successfully lifting a given weight $w$;
>2. $p(w)$ is exactly known by all competitors, continuous, strictly decreasing as the w increases, $p(0) = 1,$ and $p(w) \rightarrow 0$ as $w \rightarrow \infty$; and

## Solution

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
\text{Player 1 est bet} & \text{Player 1 odds} & \text{Player}\, x\,\text{odds} & \text{Player}\, y\,\text{odds} \\ \hline
1 & (1-x)(1-y) & x & y(1-x) \\ \hline
x & \dfrac{x}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)} & \dfrac{x(1-x)}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)} & \dfrac{y(1-x)^2}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)} \\ \hline
y & \dfrac{y(1-x)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} & \dfrac{x}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} & \dfrac{y(1-x)(1-y)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

There's a symmetry between the $1$-lead and $x$-lead situations. The chance for player $x$ to win in the $x$-lead situation is the same as the $1$-lead situation, multiplied by the factor

$$ f(x,y) = \dfrac{1-x}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)}. $$

The same is true for player $y$'s chances. Multiplying player $1$'s odds by $(1-x)(1-x)$ the chances in the $x$-lead scenario become

$$ \mathbf{p_x} = f(x,y) \langle\dfrac{x}{1-x}, x, y(1-x)\rangle. $$

$\sum_i p_x(i) = 1,$ so if $f(x,y) > 1,$ then player $1$'s odds will be better betting on $1,$ and if $f(x,y) < 1,$ then player $1$'s odds will be better betting on $x.$ In either case, this choice is to the detriment of players $x$ and $y.$ 

So, $x$ and $y$ are incentivized to set $f(x,y)$ to $1.$

Setting $f(x,y) = 1$ gets us

$$ y = 1 - \frac{x}{(1-x)^2}. $$
