>**Question**: The Robot Weightlifting World Championshipâ€™s final round is about to begin! Three robots, seeded 1, 2, and 3, remain in contention. They take turns from the 3rd seed to the 1st seed publicly declaring exactly how much weight (any nonnegative real number) they will attempt to lift, and no robot can choose exactly the same amount as a previous robot. Once the three weights have been announced, the robots attempt their lifts, and the robot that successfully lifts the most weight is the winner. If all robots fail, they just repeat the same lift amounts until at least one succeeds.

>Assume the following:
>
>1. all the robots have the same probability $p(w)$ of successfully lifting a given weight $w$;
>2. $p(w)$ is exactly known by all competitors, continuous, strictly decreasing as the w increases, $p(0) = 1,$ and $p(w) \rightarrow 0$ as $w \rightarrow \infty$; and
>3. all competitors want to maximize their chance of winning the RWWC.

## Solution

When the first seed's time comes, they find a betting landscape set by the bets of $x$ and $y.$ They have three materially different choices: frontrun $x,$ frontrun $y,$ or bet behind $y.$

### Player 1, X and Y's chances to win

As an illustrative example, suppose that Player 1 decides to frontrun Player Y, so that $x < z < y.$ For Player 1 to win a round in this case, they need their lift to succeed (probability $x$) and Player X's lift to fail (probability $1-x$), since a successful heavier lift would beat them. Similarly, Player Y needs their lift to succeed (probability $y$), and the other two to fail (probability $(1-x)(1-z).$ However, these three outcomes aren't exhaustive... it is possible for noone to win the round, in which case the game starts over. So, we have to normalize by the chance that **something** happens, $1-(1-x)(1-y)(1-z).$

By this logic, Player 1's chances in the three situations are ($z$ is Player 1's lift probability)

$$ \frac{z}{1-(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)}, $$

$$ \frac{z(1-x)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)},$$

and

$$ \frac{z(1-x)(1-y)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)(1-z)}. $$

These are monotonically increasing in $z,$ so Player 1 only has to consider $x,$ $y,$ and $1.$ When this is done, the chances for each player in the three scenarios are

$$
\begin{array}{|c|l|l|l|} \hline
\text{Player 1's bet} & \text{Player 1 odds} & \text{Player}\, x\,\text{odds} & \text{Player}\, y\,\text{odds} \\ \hline
1 & P_1^1 = (1-x)(1-y) & P_1^X = x & P_1^Y = y(1-x) \\ \hline
x & P_X^1 = \dfrac{x}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)} & P_X^X = \dfrac{x(1-x)}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)} & P_X^Y = \dfrac{y(1-x)^2}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)} \\ \hline
y & P_Y^1 = \dfrac{y(1-x)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} & P_Y^X = \dfrac{x}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} & P_Y^Y = \dfrac{y(1-x)(1-y)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} \\ \hline
\end{array}
$$

Player 1 will pick whichever of their three options is greatest, given the values of $x$ and $y:$

$$ \text{Player 1's bet} = \max\{P_X^1(x,y), P_Y^1(x,y), P_1^1(x,y)\}. $$

### The betting landscape

TODO

### Player X's incentives 

For small $x$ and $y,$ $P_1^1(x,y)$ is Player 1's best choice. In this regime, Player X and Player Y's chances are simply $x$ and $y(1-x)$ and both can increase their chances by setting their lift probability as high as possible. 

Player X can follow this strategy up until they hit the border $P_1^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y),$ beyond which Player 1 will switch from betting $1$ to frontrunning Player X. What then?

Inspecting the probabilities, Player X's chance in the $x$-lead is equal to the chance in the $1$-lead multiplied by $f(x,y) = (1-x)/(1-(1-x)^2(1-y)).$ 

In other words, $P_1^X(x,y) = f(x,y)\times P_X^X(x,y).$ Likewise, $P_1^Y(x,y) = f(x,y)\times P_X^Y(x,y).$ 

Along this border, $P_1^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y).$ Because $\sum_i P_1^i = \sum_i P_X^i = 1,$ this means that 

$$\begin{align}
P_1^X(x,y) + P_1^Y(x,y) &= P_X^X(x,y) + P_X^Y(x,y) \\
&= f(x,y)\times \left( P_1^X(x,y) + P_1^Y(x,y)\right),
\end{align}$$ 

or, $f(x,y) = 1.$ 

$f(x,y)$ is monotonically decreasing in $x$ and $y,$ so on the $1$-lead side of the border (small $x$ and $y$), $f(x,y) > 1$ and on the other side, $f(x,y) < 1.$ 

### Player Y's incentives at the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_Y^1(x,y)$ border

In $x$-lead, Player Y is incentivized to set $y$ as high as possible without crossing the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_Y^1(x,y)$ border. 

On the other side of this border, 

$$ P_Y^Y(x,y) = \frac{y(1-y)(1-x)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} = y(1-y)\times g(x,y).$$ 

At the point where the border intercepts the $y$-axis, $g(x,y) = 1$ and it decreases monotonically in $x$ and $y$ from there. This means that $P_Y^1(x,y) \leq 1/4$ for all points across the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_Y^1(x,y)$ border. 

However, the $y$-intercept of the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_Y^1(x,y)$ border is $\frac12(3-\sqrt{5}) \approx 0.382 \gt \frac14,$ so Player Y will never veer into the $y$-lead regime. 

### Player X's prospects at the $P_Y^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y)$ border

If Player X crosses the $P_Y^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y)$ border, Player Y benefits by making $y$ as big as possible, without going into the $y$-lead regime. This means that any foray into $x$-lead territory will bring the game up to the $P_Y^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y)$ border. 

How does Player X fare there? We can solve for when the slope of $P_X^X(x,y)$ is less than zero:

$$ \frac{\partial P_X^X(x,y)}{\partial x} < 0 $$

which gets

$$ y \gt \dfrac{x^2}{(1-x)^2}. $$

Now, by definition, $P_Y^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y)$ along the border, so

$$ \dfrac{y(1-x)}{1-(1-x)(1-y)^2} = \dfrac{x}{1-(1-x)^2(1-y)}. $$

Since $(1-x) > (1-y),$ this means that $y(1-x) > x,$ or $y > x/(1-x).$ 

The border ends at $x = \frac12,$ so $x/(1-x) < 1$ for all relevant values of $x,$ and so 

$$
\begin{align}
y &\gt \frac{x}{1-x} \\
  &\gt \left(\dfrac{x}{1-x}\right)^2.
\end{align}
$$

So, $P_X^X(x,y)$ decreases monotonically along the border and Player X does not benefit in bringing the game up to the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y)$ border.

Putting it all together:

- Player X will make $x$ as high as possible without allowing Player Y to move the game into $x$-lead territory, and 
- Player Y will make $y$ as high as possible without bringing the game into $y$-lead territory. 
- $x$-lead territory lies across the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y)$ border and $y$-lead territory lies across the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_Y^1(x,y)$ border.

This means that the point where the $P_1^1(x,y) = P_Y^1(x,y)$ and $P_1^1(x,y) = P_X^1(x,y)$ borders intersect is optimal for Players X and Y.

## Strategy recap

To recap, Player X sets $x$ as high as they can, knowing that it never benefits them to go into the $x$-lead regime.
