>**Question**: another day, another demented hostage situation whose only salvation is twisted hat logic. The potentate of puzzles has kidnapped, blindfolded, and placed a red, green, or blue cap upon the head of you and $4$ of your unluckiest friends. Furthermore, they've split you up into two rows of $3$ and $2$ apiece. On opening your eyes, you can see the colors of the hats of the people in the opposite row. With nothing more than this information, and knowledge of your own position in the arrangement, you have to guess the color of your hat. If at least one person guesses correctly you all survive, otherwise it's time for the long nap. Is there a strategy that guarantees your survival?
