## Solution

On first glance, Davis has a pretty nice advantage since he takes possession of the ball after every missed three point shot. However, Lebron has a chance to steal **every** time Davis takes possession. If Lebron was barred from stealing in the case where Davis starts the game with the ball, then the 1:1 would be perfectly symmetric if the probability $L_\text{steal}$ was $1/2.$ Since Lebron can steal in the first possession, we should expect the $L_\text{steal}$ required for a fair game to be something less than $1/2.$
