## Solution

the twist between the ends of the prism determines what prism face you end up on after one loop.


for example, with no twist you stay on the same face and, so, each face forms its own distinct side of the prism.

as another example, giving a hexagonal prism a twist of $2$ sets up the map

$$
  \begin{array}{c}
    123456 \\
    \downarrow \\
    345612
  \end{array}
$$
