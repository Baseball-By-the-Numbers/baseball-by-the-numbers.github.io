>**Question:** You are on the $10^\text{th}$ floor of a tower and want to exit on the first floor. You get into the elevator and hit $1.$ However, this elevator is malfunctioning in a specific way. When you hit $1,$ it correctly registers the request to descend, but it randomly selects some floor below your current floor (including the first floor). The car then stops at that floor. If itâ€™s not the first floor, you again hit $1$ and the process repeats.

>Assuming you are the only passenger on the elevator, how many floors on average will it stop at (including your final stop, the first floor) until you exit?

## Solution

To avoid finicky bookkeeping, we can count the lobby as floor zero, instead of floor $1$. Also, it's equivalent to think in terms of how many times the passenger will press the button, and that's what we'll do.

When the passenger presses the button from floor $(k+1),$ they can either go to floor $k,$ or go to floors $0$ through $(k-1),$ which is the same as starting from floor $k$ but with one less button press.

This says that the expected number of button presses from floor $(k+1)$ is 

$$
  \begin{align}
    \langle B_{k+1} \rangle &= \frac1k\left(\langle B_k\rangle + 1\right) + \left(1-\frac1k\right) \langle B_k\rangle \\
    &= \frac1k + \langle B_k\rangle,
  \end{align}
$$

<!-- When the passenger presses the button from floor $k,$ the elevator is equally likely to end up at any floor under it. 

So, they have uniform probability $\frac1k$ to arrive at any of the floors, which can be the lobby in one press or else any of the $(k-1)$ floors above the lobby from which they will make an average of $\langle B_{k-1}\rangle$ more presses.

So the expected value of the number of button presses from floor $k$ is equal to

$$
  \langle B_k\rangle = \dfrac1k + \dfrac1k\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\left(1 + \langle B_j\rangle\right).
$$

The second term is just $\langle B_{k-1}\rangle,$

$$
\begin{align}
  \langle B_k\rangle &= \dfrac1k + \dfrac1k[\langle B_{k-1}\rangle + \overbrace{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{k-2}\left(1 + \langle B_j\rangle\right)}^{\left(k-1\right)\langle B_{k-1}\rangle}] \\
  &= \dfrac1k + \dfrac1k\left[\langle B_{k-1}\rangle + \left(k-1\right)\langle B_{k-1}\rangle\right] \\
  &= \dfrac1k + \langle B_{k-1}\rangle,
$$
\end{align} -->


so 

$$
  \langle B_k\rangle = 1 + \dfrac12 + \dfrac13 + \ldots + \dfrac1k,
$$ 

the $k^\text{th}$ harmonic number.

For the $9$ story building in question, this is $\frac{7129}{2520} \approx 
2.829$ button presses.
